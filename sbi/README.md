# IAIFI Astro Hackathon: Tutorial on Simulation-Based Inference

Tentative plan:
- Notebook adapted from the MIT tutorials, covering implicit likelihoods, NRE, NPE, ABC, Coverage
- Notebook using Quijote data and GNNs
- Hackathon ideas: MMD-based mismodeling adaptation, applying to own simulator, improving Quijote-based SBI as you choose
