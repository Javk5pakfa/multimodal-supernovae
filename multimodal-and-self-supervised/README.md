# IAIFI Astro Hackathon: Tutorial on Self-Supervised and Multimodal Learning

Placeholder repo for the IAIFI Astro Hackathon tutorial on self-supervised and multimodal learning. Tentative plan:
- Notebook on self-supervision, examples in astro, basic concepts, and references. 
- Examples of training self-supervised representation encoders via augmentations and masking
- Hackathon idea 1: GeoCLIP equivalent similar in function to astrometry.net
- Hackathon idea 2: SSL with ZTF light curves and images?
